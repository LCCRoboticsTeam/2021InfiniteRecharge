 *        This class handles network connections. You can choose to either
 *        connect to a specified IP address or to listen for incoming
 *        connections of a specified port.
 *
 *        In either case, a two way connection is established. The receiver end
 *        of the connection is handled via a separate thread and there is a
 *        callback provided when data is received.
 *
 *        The transmit side runs in whatever thread the calling function is
 *        using.
